# Build auto encoder with pytorch
    * Get the render right
        * Its broken, maybe try out a separate script to get it right
    * Why so slow?
    * Graph loss vs epoch
    * animate with mathmatica
    * clustering stack traces with an autoencoder?

# Intro Chapter
    * Convert to NN
    * Rewrite math chapter
    * Graph the loss using matplotlib
    * Graph y_true vs y_pred
    * Use the MLP on the math vectors
