Standardization is a technique used to scale the features (input variables) so that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. In more concrete terms, for each feature \( x \) in the dataset, the standardized value \( z \) is calculated as follows:

\[
z = \frac{{x - \text{{mean}}(x)}}{{\text{{std}}(x)}}
\]

Here, \(\text{{mean}}(x)\) is the mean of the feature \( x \) across all samples, and \(\text{{std}}(x)\) is the standard deviation of the feature \( x \) across all samples.

### Intuition

Imagine you have two features: one ranges from 0 to 1 and the other from 0 to 1000. The feature with the larger range will dominate the learning process because its values will have a larger effect on the loss and, hence, the gradients. Standardizing these features will bring them onto a similar scale.

### Benefits

1. **Faster Convergence:** Gradient descent converges faster when the features are on a similar scale.
2. **Improved Generalization:** Standardization can make the algorithm less sensitive to the scale of features. This could lead to better generalization on the test set.
3. **Numerical Stability:** Many machine learning algorithms, like k-means clustering or principal component analysis (PCA), assume that all features have the same scale. Standardization satisfies this assumption.

### Code Example

Here's a simple Python code snippet using NumPy to standardize data:

```python
import numpy as np

def standardize_data(X):
    mean_X = np.mean(X, axis=0)
    std_X = np.std(X, axis=0)
    X_standardized = (X - mean_X) / std_X
    return X_standardized

# Example usage
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
X_standardized = standardize_data(X)
```

In this example, `X` is a 3x3 NumPy array. We calculate the mean and standard deviation for each feature (column in this case) and then apply the standardization.

This technique should work well in most cases. However, if your data has many outliers, they could impact the mean and standard deviation significantly, in which case, you might want to consider robust scaling techniques.
