# Neural Network

Our Multilevel perceptron was a good way to get started, but to build out other algorithms specifically the
encoder/decoder in level 

shape: `(input_units, output_units)`
`z = x.dot(self.weights) + self.bias`
Here, x should have a shape (batch_size, input_units) and self.weights would have a shape (input_units, output_units). The resulting z would have a shape (batch_size, output_units).
