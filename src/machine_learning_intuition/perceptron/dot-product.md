The dot product of two matrices involves a series of multiplications and summations. It's a fundamental operation in linear algebra and is widely used in machine learning, data science, and finance for tasks like transformations, projections, and predictions.

### Intuition
Imagine you have a group of people (rows in matrix $\( A \)$) and each person can perform various tasks (columns in matrix $\( A \)$). Now, you have a set of projects (columns in matrix $\( B \)$) that require different amounts of each task (rows in matrix $\( B \)$). The dot product essentially tells you how much of each project each person can complete.

### Concrete Explanation
Let's consider two matrices $\( A \)$ and $\( B \)$. $\( A \)$ is of shape $\( m \times n \)$ and $\( B \)$ is of shape $\( n \times p \)$.

- $\( m \)$ is the number of rows in $\( A \)$, representing different "entities" (e.g., data points, people).
- $\( n \)$ is the number of columns in $\( A \)$ and rows in $\( B \)$, representing the "features" or "tasks" (e.g., dimensions, skills).
- $\( p \)$ is the number of columns in $\( B \)$, representing different "outcomes" (e.g., projects, classes).

When you perform the dot product $\( A \cdot B \)$, you're essentially asking, "For each entity in $\( A \)$, how much do they contribute to each outcome in $\( B \)$?"

### Why $\( m \times p \)$?
For each of the $\( m \)$ rows in $\( A \)$, you're calculating its contribution to each of the $\( p \)$ columns in $\( B \)$. So, you end up with $\( m \)$ different entities each having $\( p \)$ different outcomes, making the resulting matrix $\( C \)$ of shape $\( m \times p \)$.

### Mathematical Formulation
_Let's say we have two matrices $$\( A \)$$ and $$\( B \)$$. $$\( A \)$$ is of shape $$\( m \times n \)$$ and $$\( B \)$$ is of shape $$\( n \times p \)$$. The dot product $$\( C = A \cdot B \)$$ will be a matrix of shape $$\( m \times p \)$$.

The element $$\( C_{ij} \)$$ at the $$\( i^{th} \)$$ row and $$\( j^{th} \)$$ column of $$\( C \)$$ is calculated as follows:_

### Rule for Matrix Multiplication
The rule for matrix multiplication states that for two matrices \( A \) and \( B \) to be multipliable, the number of columns in \( A \) must be equal to the number of rows in \( B \). Mathematically, if \( A \) is \( m \times n \) and \( B \) is \( n \times p \), then \( C = A \times B \) will be \( m \times p \).

### Example with Compatible Matrices
To give you a concrete example, let's consider a 2x2 matrix multiplied by a 2x3 matrix:

\( A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \) (Shape: \( 2 \times 2 \))

\( B = \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 6 & 7 \\ 8 & 9 & 10 \end{pmatrix} \) (Shape: \( 2 \times 3 \))

#### Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **Initialize Result Matrix**: Create a zero matrix \( C \) of shape \( 2 \times 3 \).
2. **First Row of \( A \) with All Columns of \( B \)**:
    - \( C_{11} = 1 \times 5 + 2 \times 8 = 5 + 16 = 21 \)
    - \( C_{12} = 1 \times 6 + 2 \times 9 = 6 + 18 = 24 \)
    - \( C_{13} = 1 \times 7 + 2 \times 10 = 7 + 20 = 27 \)
3. **Second Row of \( A \) with All Columns of \( B \)**:
    - \( C_{21} = 3 \times 5 + 4 \times 8 = 15 + 32 = 47 \)
    - \( C_{22} = 3 \times 6 + 4 \times 9 = 18 + 36 = 54 \)
    - \( C_{23} = 3 \times 7 + 4 \times 10 = 21 + 40 = 61 \)

#### Result
\( C = \begin{pmatrix} 21 & 24 & 27 \\ 47 & 54 & 61 \end{pmatrix} \) (Shape: \( 2 \times 3 \))

### Python Code Snippet
Here's a Python code snippet to perform matrix dot product using nested loops:

```python
import numpy as np

def matrix_dot(A, B):
    m, n = A.shape
    n, p = B.shape
    C = np.zeros((m, p))
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(p):
            sum = 0
            for k in range(n):
                sum += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
            C[i, j] = sum
            
    return C

# Example usage
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
C = matrix_dot(A, B)
print(f"Result of A dot B: \n{C}")
```
