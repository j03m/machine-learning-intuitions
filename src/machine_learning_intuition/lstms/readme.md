# stuff to know:


Hidden State (h): This represents the short-term memory of the network.
Cell State (c): This represents the long-term memory.

Both states are passed from one step of the sequence to the next. 
In PyTorch's LSTM implementation, these states are often combined into a tuple, commonly referred to as hidden.
