To provide a structured pseudocode summary of the TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm based on your code and requirements, here's a clear, high-level overview:

### TD3 Pseudocode Overview

1. **Initialization**
   - **Create Actor-Critic Model:** Initialize an actor-critic model with two Q-functions (`q1`, `q2`) and one policy network (`pi`).
   - **Clone for Target Networks:** Make a deep copy of the actor-critic model to create target networks (`ac_targ`) which are used for stable Q-value estimation.
   - **Initialize Replay Buffer:** Set up a replay buffer to store experience tuples (state, action, reward, next state, done).

2. **Exploration and Data Collection**
   - **Random Action Selection:** For the first `start_steps`, select actions randomly to populate the replay buffer with diverse experiences.
   - **Policy Action Selection:** After `start_steps`, use the policy network (`ac.pi`) to determine actions, augmented with noise (`act_noise`) for exploration.

3. **Learning Process**
   - **Sampling from Replay Buffer:** Regularly sample batches of experiences from the replay buffer after `update_after` steps.
   - **Q-function Updates:**
     - For each sample, compute the current Q-values using both Q-functions (`q1` and `q2`).
     - Calculate the target actions from the next states using the target policy network (`ac_targ.pi`), add noise (`target_noise`), and clip it using `noise_clip`.
     - Evaluate these noisy target actions using the target Q-functions to estimate the next-state Q-values; take the minimum of these two estimates for stability.
     - Compute the target Q-values using the Bellman equation and update both Q-functions by minimizing the MSE loss between the current and target Q-values.
   - **Policy Updates:**
     - Delay policy updates (`policy_delay`), ensuring the policy is updated less frequently than the Q-functions to stabilize training.
     - Update the policy by maximizing the expected Q-value output from one of the Q-functions.
   - **Target Network Updates:**
     - After updating the policy, use Polyak averaging to update the weights of the target networks to slowly track the primary networks.

4. **Execution and Testing**
   - **Action Execution in Environment:** Execute chosen actions in the environment, store the results in the replay buffer, and manage the state transitions.
   - **Performance Evaluation:** Periodically test the policy deterministically without exploration noise and log performance metrics.

5. **Logging and Saving**
   - **Save Models and Log Performance:** Regularly save the model parameters and log training performance metrics.

### TD3 Algorithm Specifics

- **Two Q-functions and a Policy Network:** TD3 uses two Q-functions to mitigate positive bias in the policy improvement step that comes from the maximization of Q-values as seen in DDPG.
- **Target Policy Smoothing:** Adds noise to the actions used in the target policy to smooth out the Q-value estimates, which helps prevent overfitting to narrow peaks in the Q-function.
- **Delayed Policy Updates:** Updating the policy less frequently than the Q-functions helps ensure that the Q-function estimates are stable and reliable before each policy update, reducing the risk of the policy exploiting outdated or incorrect Q-values.

### Execution

If you're setting this up in an actual environment, ensure all components are initialized correctly, and tune hyperparameters like `gamma` (discount factor), `polyak` (target network update rate), and exploration noise settings to suit your specific environment.

This pseudocode gives a high-level blueprint of the TD3 algorithm, highlighting its core components and the interactions between them.
