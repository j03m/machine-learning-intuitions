1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an actor-critic model (`ac`) with a policy network (actor, `pi`) and a Q-function network (critic, `q`).
   - Clone this actor-critic model to create the target networks (`ac_targ`). This cloning copies both the actor and critic networks.
   - Initialize a replay buffer to store transition tuples of (state, action, reward, next state, done flag).

2. **Exploration and Data Collection**:
   - For each step:
     - For the first `N` steps, randomly sample actions from the action space to encourage exploration.
     - After `N` steps, use the primary network actor (`ac.pi`) to determine actions based on the current state, optionally adding noise for continued exploration.
     - Execute the chosen action in the environment, observe the next state, reward, and done flag.
     - Store the transition (current state, action, reward, next state, done flag) in the replay buffer.

3. **Learning Updates**:
   - After a certain number of steps (`M`), perform a learning update:
     - Sample a batch of transitions of size `B` from the replay buffer.
     - For each sampled transition:
       - **Compute the Critic's Loss**:
         - Use the primary network critic (`ac.q`) to compute Q-values for the current state and action (gradient tracking enabled).
         - With `torch.no_grad()`:
           - Use the target network actor (`ac_targ.pi`) to predict the next action from the next state.
           - Use the target network critic (`ac_targ.q`) to compute the Q-value for the next state and the action suggested by the target actor.
           - Calculate the target Q-value (`backup`) using the formula: \( r + \gamma \times (1 - d) \times q\_pi\_targ \).
         - Calculate the mean squared error loss between the Q-values from the primary network and the `backup` values.
         - Backpropagate this loss and step the optimizer to update the primary network critic.

       - **Compute the Actor's Loss**:
         - Use the primary network actor (`ac.pi`) to propose an action for the current state.
         - Calculate the Q-value of this state-action pair using the primary network critic (`ac.q`), with gradients enabled.
         - Compute the loss as the negative mean of these Q-values (since the actor aims to maximize the Q-values).
         - Backpropagate this loss and step the optimizer to update the primary network actor.

4. **Update Target Networks**:
   - Use Polyak averaging to update the weights of the target networks (`ac_targ`) towards the weights of the primary networks (`ac`). This is done using in-place operations that gradually mix the primary network weights into the target network weights, stabilizing the learning process.

5. **Action Selection with Noise**:
   - When selecting actions from the primary actor (`ac.pi`), optionally add noise to the actions to ensure adequate exploration, especially in the earlier phases of training.
