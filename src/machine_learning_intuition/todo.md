# Data

After the initial MLP chapter, should we start using real data sets?


# MLP Chapter

* Graph the loss using matplotlib
* Graph y_true vs y_pred
* Use the MLP on the math vectors

# Autoencoder

* Fix bugs :/
* Find better easy mode example
* Consider compressing to 2 dimensions and graphing latent dimensions
  * Consider doing this over time to show how training progresses if there are multi categories
  * Animation?
* Autoencoder as a generative model!
*
